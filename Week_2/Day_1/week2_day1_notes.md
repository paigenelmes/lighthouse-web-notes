## Week 2 : Day 1

### Six types of primitives
1. Undefined
2. Null
3. Boolean
4. String
5. Number
6. Symbol

Primitives are the `simplest possible data types`.

### Objects are NOT primitives!

Anything `not on the list above` is an `object`.

Objects include `objects`, `arrays`, and `functions`.

`Objects` have `Properties`. 

### Seven fundamental Javascript types
These are the `6 primitives` plus `Objects`.

### Objects

1. Contain `key value pairs`; each `key` maps to a `value`.
2. `Keys` are always `strings` (or symbols but don't worry about that now)
3. `Keys` are `unique`; the `same key cannot appear twice` in an object 
4. `Keys` point to `values`; `values` can be `any type`.

### Object Literals

Empty Object Literal example:
```javascript
const emptyObject = {};
```
